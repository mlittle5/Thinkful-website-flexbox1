  <h3>I have been developing a passion for web design ever since I started studying at Thinkful.</h3>
  <img src="images/computer_surfing_sm.gif" alt="a computer surfing" />
  <p> I find that coding is simmilar to music in many ways. It is all about putting a lot of small detailed things together to produce a larger product.</p>
  <p>During my time in the Thinkful program I have been seeing many paralells to learning music and coding webdesign and I have been very happy with the material I have learned how to produce.,?p>

    <h3>I would love to work on a team with other coders in real life.</h3>

    </div>
    <div class="item">
      <h3>What is this project about?</h3>
      <p>This is a metronome that can be used by anyone who has an internet connection.</p>
      <p> A metronome is an incredibly useful tool when practicing any kind of music, and having access to a metronome anywhere you have an internet connection is extremely helpful.</p>
      <p> The skills used in creating this project are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A blinking light animation</li>
        <li>Playing a sound at a constant rate</li>
        <li>being able to adjust the rate at which the metronome clicks</li>
      </ul>
